The build is great for beginners learning how to surface mount solder. All the passives are 0805 and there is only 1 IC with a pretty wide pitch.


Note: The trim pots can go on either side; it's up to you. To adjust the trim pots, measure the voltage of the signal going in to a channel and adjust the corresponding channel's trim pot so the output has the same voltage.
